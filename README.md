# Vigenere Encryption Decryption Algorithm

### About Algorithm Used

The vigenere cipher is an algorithm that is used to encrypting and decrypting the text. The vigenere cipher is an algorithm of encrypting an alphabetic text that uses a series of interwoven caesar ciphers. It is based on a keyword's letters. It is an example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. This algorithm is easy to understand and implement. This algorithm was first described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso. It uses a Vigenere table or Vigenere square for encryption and decryption of the text. The vigenere table is also called the tabula recta.
